## About The Project

Not the best picture but the I used just a label maker because for me it doesn't have to be a work of art LOL <br>
Still have 4 buttons I haven't assigned yet but you get the idea....

<br>
A few examples... you can use automations, scripts, switches, buttons, lights...etc and make them a button! <br>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

GO watch this video by Paul Hibbert because this is only possible because of his work!!!  <br>
Youtube Video <br><br> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0DFPBQbWQ&t=613s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0DFPBQbWQ&t=613s)
 

### Installation

There is really NO installation but I will point this out......... IF you're using the keyboard he suggests then put the 
battery in the keyboard THEN put the dongle into the computer.

There is a yaml file you can use if you need examples.  I don't use the built in automation maker in HA, I'd rather <br>
I prefer to write the yaml myself.
