<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

GO watch this video by Paul Hibbert because this is only possible because of his work!!!
Youtube Video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0DFPBQbWQ&t=613s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0DFPBQbWQ&t=613s)
 

### Installation

There is really NO installation but I will point this out......... IF you're using the keyboard he suggests then put the 
battery in the keyboard THEN put the dongle into the computer.

Paul Hibbert has MANY cool videos.... and he's fun to watch.. LOL

follow his directions exactly because even though I used the same keyboard the key codes were
still different!!

key_code: 128=Num lock 
key_code: 98= /
key_code: 55= *
key_code: 74= -
key_code: 71= 7
key_code: 72= 8
key_code: 73= 9
key_code: 75= 4
key_code: 76= 5
key_code: 77= 6
key_code: 78= +
key_code: 79= 1
key_code: 80= 2
key_code: 81= 3
